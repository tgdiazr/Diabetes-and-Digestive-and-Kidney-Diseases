🏥 Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction
📌 Overview
This project analyzes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, originally provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical diagnostic measurements.

All patients in the dataset are female, at least 21 years old, and of Pima Indian heritage.

📊 Dataset Details
Rows: 768
Columns: 9
Features (8): Number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function.
Target (1): Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).
🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project performs an in-depth EDA to understand feature distributions, detect outliers, and analyze relationships between medical attributes:
✅ Histograms & Density Plots – Visualizing how each feature is distributed.
✅ Boxplots – Identifying potential outliers in medical measurements.
✅ Correlation Heatmap – Exploring relationships between different features.
✅ Pairplot – Examining feature interactions, color-coded by diabetes outcome.
